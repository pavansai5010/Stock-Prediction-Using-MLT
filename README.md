
**Stock Price Prediction Using Linear Regression**

**Overview:**

This project aims to predict future stock prices using a Linear Regression machine learning algorithm. By analyzing historical stock market data, the model attempts to establish a linear relationship between the features (such as date, historical prices, etc.) and the stock's closing price. The project provides insights into the stock's potential future value, which can be useful for traders, investors, and financial analysts.

**Project Structure :**

- **data/**: This directory contains the historical stock market data used for training and testing the model.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks with detailed steps for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.
- **models/**: Directory to save trained models.
- **scripts/**: Python scripts for data processing, model training, and prediction.
- **README.md**: Project description and instructions (this file).

**Key Features**

- **Data Collection**: Uses historical stock price data from sources like Yahoo Finance or other financial APIs.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, feature selection, and data normalization.
- **Model Training**: Implements a Linear Regression model using scikit-learn to learn the relationship between input features and the stock's closing price.
- **Prediction**: Predicts the future stock prices based on the trained model.
- **Visualization**: Generates graphs comparing actual vs. predicted prices to evaluate model performance.

**Dependencies :**

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `plotly` (for interactive visualizations)

You can install the dependencies using:
